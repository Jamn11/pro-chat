# Settings Panel
Next up is a redesign of the settings window.

Right now it is not very information dense at all.

Key change is making it into a tab view (as in, there are multiple tabs the user can click through to change various things).

Things I want to add to the settings area:
- default model + thinking level (for a new chat)
- Choose what models to include in the selector from OpenRouter
- Cost/usage analysis panel
- Notifications
- Fonts
- Which tools to allow the use of
- Hide cost per message, then give a setting to turn it back on

# Random
- LLM for chat titles
- Strengthening connection-loss handling (like what happens if the user refreshes or whatever while an answer is generating)
